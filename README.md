# Kennedy_Noah_FIP
This is my Final Integrated Project for Interactive Media Design Term 1.
My website is a clothing board under the name Kennedy Clothing. On this site you can find an index page, a gallery page, and their respective mobile counterparts.
I created the name, logo, colour palette, and most of the ideas on my own free time. I feel this project has definitely improved my skills with HTML and CSS, but I still have a ways to go and that's fine with me. I hope you like my website as much as I do.
